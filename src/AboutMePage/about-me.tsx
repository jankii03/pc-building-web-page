            <h1>About Me and NovaLine PC's</h1>
            <p>
             Hello! I'm Januel E. Torres Marquez, an undergraduate Software Engineering student at the University of Puerto Rico, MayagÃ¼ez Campus. 
             My academic pursuits are perfectly complemented by my enduring passion for software, technology, and, most importantly, PC building; the 
             driving force behind NovaLine PC's.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey into the world of custom computing began in October 2020. Frustrated by off-the-shelf limitations and driven by a desire to 
              fully optimize my own computing experience, I took the leap. By the close of that year, I had successfully completed my very first custom build. 
              This initial success marked the start of a rewarding passion. Since then, I've had the pleasure of building multiple high-performance PCs for myself, 
              friends, and family, with each project consistently sharpening my technical skills and deepening my expertise in computer hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building on this hands-on experience, I've dedicated myself to mastering the details of component compatibility, performance optimization, and 
              budget-conscious planning. This comprehensive knowledge empowers me to do more than just assemble; I help others craft their truly ideal PC setups, 
              meticulously tailored to their specific needs, workflows, and budgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              With NovaLine PC's, I aim to share this knowledge and passion with a wider audience. My goal is to guide you in achieving your own dream build with 
              confidence and ease, transforming what can seem like a complex task into an exciting and rewarding experience. Let's build something incredible together! ðŸš€
